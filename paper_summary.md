# paper summary 
In recent years, artificial neural networks have shown excellent performance in pattern recognition and regression. (Deep learning in neural networks: An overview
) The convolutional neural network got unbelievable scores in image classification. So what is neural newtwork? Why doee it perform so good?

Let's begin by first understanding what consist of neural network. Neuron and activation function are the two main part in Neural network. In fact, A neuron is just a function, receiving several inputs and giving the result. Typically, those inputs are summed with weights, and this sum is passed through a nonlinear function, often called activation function, such as the sigmoid, relu, and so on. Above is a neuron model, and aritifical neural network consists of numbers of neurons. Different architecture of neurons have different performance. Convolution neuron network can be used in image. Long short-term memory can process sequances of data, such as speech and voice. We are devoted to find more effective architectures to sovle different problems. Our goal is to find a architecture having excellent in different realms.

Now we know tha neural network is the combination of linear functions and nonlinear functions. So the challenge is how to determine the weights in the linear functions. We can denote neural network as y = NN(x). x is the inputs, and y is the outputs of the neural networks. In order to evaluate the NN function, we can define the loss(x,w) function according to different problem. So the challenge become a optimal problem to minimize the loss function. Intuitively we want to get the derivative of w. And the backward propogate algorithm, a main algorithm in neural network, is frome the thought of derivative.
